## History

Zinc began about 10 years ago as a collection of functions wrapping the mysql_* functions in a database abstraction
layer. It later added a front controller, and integration with the "Smarty template system":http://smarty.net. The
database abstraction layer evolved into a robust system of classes. It continued to grown and various versions have been
open sourced under different names, the latest of which was "Zoop":http://zoopframework.com.

This project began as a "from the ground up" audit of all everything in Zoop and most of the non-third-party code has
been rewritten from scratch. The new code is much cleaner and leaner than the old code. It eliminates a lot of legacy
cruft that was holding it back.

It was originally housed here "http://code.google.com/p/zoop/":http://code.google.com/p/zoop/ as an experimental branch
of Zoop. Some of the code has been merged with the mainstream Zoop project but at this point it is ready to become it's
own stand alone framework. The two projects may still share code at times but they are moving in very different
directions and are unlikely to ever fully merge.
