## Status

Zinc is under fairly constant development. The API remains fairly stable but occasionally it does break. The first
release of Zinc will be 0.1. We will develop and publish a roadmap of features that must be implemented before we get to
1.0 and release a fully stable version. It is ready at this point to build production applications with but if you do so
I would recommend following the mailing list. Updates to Zinc may break your Application. These breaks are however
infrequent and usually trivial to fix. If any update to Zinc breaks your code please post your problem to the mailing
list and we will do the best we can to help you get it fixed.
